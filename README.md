# FastAPI Firebase User Management

This is a FastAPI project that integrates with Firebase Firestore to manage user data. The API allows performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user management.

## Features

- **Create a user**: Add new users to Firestore.
- **Read a user**: Fetch user details by email.
- **Read all users**: Fetch a list of all users in the Firestore collection.
- **Update a user**: Modify the user's name or phone number.
- **Delete a user**: Remove a user from the Firestore database.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- Firebase Project with Firestore enabled
- Firebase Admin SDK credentials

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-firebase-user-management.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
  ```
cd fastapi-firebase-user-management
```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
```

# For Windows
``` 
venv\Scripts\activate
```
# For macOS/Linux
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Firebase Setup

1.Set up Firebase and enable Firestore.

2. Create a Firebase service account and download the private key as a .json file.
3. 
3.Place the Firebase credentials .json file in the project directory (e.g., firebase_credentials.json).

5. Update the path to your Firebase credentials in the code:

```
cred = credentials.Certificate("./firebase_credentials.json")
```



Running the Application
To start the FastAPI server, run the following command:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```


Summary of Validations:

    - Prevent users from updating their email (`PUT`).
    - Handle cases where the user does not exist (`GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
